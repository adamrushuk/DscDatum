# DscDatum

Testing [Datum](https://github.com/gaelcolas/Datum) for a "Hierarchical data meta structure" for DSC.

## Goal

The main goal is to evaluate new DSC tools and techniques to find a more efficient method of using DSC.

I'll also be adding to these initial constraints / goals as I go within my
[Testing new DSC tools / techniques project](https://github.com/adamrushuk/DscDatum/projects/1):

- Must use JSON as DSC Configuration data type.
- Must show default configuration values, and overrides for multiple environments.
- Use simple DSC resources for the examples: File, WindowsFeature (IIS).
